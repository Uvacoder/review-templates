There's no definite number of hours I have spent playing this game, if I was to take a guess it would be 2000 to 3000 hours across Xbox 360, PC and the Xbox One.

That sentence alone should be enough of a review, but I can't leave it there.

This was the first game I started creating YouTube videos for and it's what I ended my channel with. It had so much content and such an active, intelligent community that everyday you'd learn and could try something new.

If you do end up buying Borderlands 2, it's worth picking up the Hansome Collection. This will give you all the DLC for both Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, another fantastic game.
