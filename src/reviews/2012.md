A disaster movie where the world ends, surprise!

The CGI is hit and miss, the plot is the world ends and the acting isn't actually that bad. Woody Harrelson was a surprise treat.

Before this movie released it had people thinking the world will end in 2012, it didn't and therefore you can watch it on Netflix in 2021. Enjoy.
