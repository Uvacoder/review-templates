I tried it and I can see how it _could_ be enjoyable, but it's not.

I cannot understand how people play simulation games, they're boring. Surely it's more fun to play the game, rather than clicking buttons and watching a computer play the game, no?

Football Manager 2021 should be renamed Gmail because all you do is read emails. Avoid if you like to actually play games.
