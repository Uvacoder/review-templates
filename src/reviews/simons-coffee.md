This has been hyped up ever since [Simons Tea](/simons-tea/) and it has failed to deliver.

There was no sugar available, so I have taken that into account in this review.

However, I want to be fair and take in all the factors of a coffee;

### Smell

It smelled like coffee so that's a plus

### Energy

I did notice a slight boost to productivity but that came at a cost, the taste...

### Taste

It was disgusting. It tasted like a sweaty orc that has crawled out of Mordor and liquified itself into coffee.
