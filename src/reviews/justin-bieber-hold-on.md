Justin Bieber, a man who is most famous for featuring on a song with Ludacris, is back at it again releasing another decent song.

I never really "liked" Justin Bieber, his music was, in short, shit and he was a terrible driver.

However, even since the "Purpose" album, I've been a big fan of Justin's music, and "Hold On" is another exceptional song. It's cheery, has catchy lyrics that I can't sing, and a cheeky little beat.

If you are still hating on Justin for ruining Ludacris' song in 2010 then you need to get past that, he's good, take a listen.
